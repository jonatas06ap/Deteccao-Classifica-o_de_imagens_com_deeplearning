The dataset includes 189 images.
Objects are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random rotation of between -45 and +45 degrees
* Random shear of between -10째 to +10째 horizontally and -10째 to +10째 vertically
